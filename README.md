# Micro services

## Spring CLoud
- Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, short lived microservices and contract testing

## Spring Cloud Netflix
- Spring Cloud Netflix provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few simple annotations, you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your application and build large distributed systems with battle-tested Netflix components. The patterns provided include Service Discovery (Eureka).

### Features
